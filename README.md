Google play store is engulfed with a few thousands of new applications regularly with a progressively huge number of designers working freely or on the other hand in a group to make them successful, with the enormous challenge from everywhere throughout the globe. 
Since most Play Store applications are free, the income model is very obscure and inaccessible regarding how the in-application buys, adverts and memberships add to the achievement of an application. In this way, an application's prosperity is normally dictated by the quantity of installation of the application and the client appraisals that it has gotten over its lifetime instead of the income is created. Application (App) ratings are feedback provided voluntarily by users and function important evaluation criteria for apps. However, these ratings can often be biased due to insufficient or missing votes. Additionally, significant differences are observed between numeric ratings and user reviews. This Study aims to predict the ratings of Google Play Store apps using machine learning Algorithms. I have tried to perform Data Analysis and prediction into the Google Play store application dataset that I have collected from Kaggle. Using Machine Learning Algorithms, I have tried to discover the relationships among various attributes present in my dataset such as which application is free or paid, about the user reviews, rating of the application.
